Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.
Place chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 45–55 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160°F).

18,Chicken and Potato Gratin With Brown Butter Cream,3 lb. skin-on bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks;7½ tsp. kosher salt divided;1 lb. small potatoes (such as fingerling or baby yukon gold) halved lengthwise;8 oz. small or medium shallots halved through root ends;5 tbsp. unsalted butter divided;¾ cup heavy cream;2 garlic cloves finely grated;½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper;¼ tsp. freshly grated or ground nutmeg;8 sprigs thyme;8 sage leaves;3½ oz. country-style bread preferably day-old torn into large pieces;1 lemon;cut into wedges (optional),"Season chicken all over with 4 tsp. salt. Place in an airtight container and cover. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°F. Toss potatoes, shallots, and 2 tsp. salt in a large bowl.
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes. Immediately remove from heat (it will continue to darken) and stir in cream, garlic, pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1½ tsp. salt. Set saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until salt is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch. Stir in thyme and sage; remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large stainless-steel skillet over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, skin side down, until golden underneath, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a 13x9"" or 3-qt. baking dish and arrange skin side up. Set skillet with pan drippings aside. Nestle potatoes and shallots around chicken (don’t place on top). Pour brown butter cream over chicken and vegetables, making sure herbs and spices are evenly dispersed and tucking herbs into vegetables so they don’t get too crispy when they bake.
Bake gratin until cream is mostly reduced and chicken and vegetables are dark golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let gratin cool 5–10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pulse bread in a food processor until pieces are about oat-size (you should have about 1¼ cups). Toss breadcrumbs in pan drippings in reserved skillet to coat. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, until deep golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Let cool.
To serve, top gratin with breadcrumbs. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over if desired.",chicken-and-potato-gratin-brown-butter-cream,3,1
19,Roasted Beets With Crispy Sunchokes and Pickled Orange-Ginger Purée,strips of zest (no pith) from 1 medium orange;2½ ounces fresh ginger (about one 5-inch piece) peeled and thinly shaved (use a mandoline if you have one);¼ cup fresh lime juice;¼ cup champagne vinegar;¼ cup sugar;2 tablespoons plus ¾ teaspoon kosher salt;2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil;½ thai chile with seeds;1½ pounds beets (use a mix of colors if possible) about 5 medium;¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil;¼ cup white wine vinegar;¼ cup water;kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper;1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil;½ cup roughly chopped cashews;4 large sunchokes thinly shaved (use a mandoline if you have one);vegetable oil;kosher salt;1 medium orange;roasted beets;extra-virgin olive oil;kosher salt;¼ cup pickled orange-ginger puree;toasted cashews;1 tablespoon roughly chopped tarragon;1 tablespoon roughly chopped dill fronds;sunchoke chips,"Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and ¾ teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.
Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.
In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about ½ cup.)
Using a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.
Drizzle the beet wedges with a little bit of olive oil, season with salt, and toss.
Spread the ginger puree on the bottom of a shallow serving bowl or plate. Arrange the beets over the puree. Sprinkle the chopped orange segments over the beets and grind some pepper over the dish. Top with the cashews, herbs, and sunchoke chips. Serve.",roasted-beets-with-crispy-sunchokes-and-pickled-orange-ginger-puree,4,1
20,Kale and Pumpkin Falafels With Pickled Carrot Slaw,¾ cup (120g or 4½ oz) toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds);3 cups (90g or 3 oz) shredded kale stems removed (about 3 large leaves);1 clove garlic crushed;1 (16 oz or 400g ) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans) rinsed drained;1½ teaspoons ground turmeric;½ cup (6g or ¼ oz) coriander (cilantro) leaves;sea salt and cracked black pepper;3 cups (450g or 1 lb) firmly packed grated pumpkin;extra virgin olive oil for brushing;plain greek-style yogurt and hulled tahini to serve;6 carrots shredded using a julienne peeler;2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar;2 tablespoons honey;2 large red chiles sliced;½ cup (6g or ¼ oz) coriander (cilantro) leaves,"Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F).

21,Maple and Chile Roasted Squash With Quinoa Tabouli,1 (2kg or 4 lb or 4 oz) butternut squash or 2 (1kg or 2 lb or 3 oz) butternut squash halved;2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil;1 tablespoon pure maple syrup;1 teaspoon chile flakes;sea salt and cracked black pepper;1/4 cup (40g or 1 ½ oz) roasted almonds chopped;2 cups (320g or 11 ¼ oz) cooked quinoa;½ cup (8g or ¼ oz) torn mint leaves;60g (2 oz) wild rocket (arugula) leaves;½ cup (140g or 5 oz) hulled tahini;⅔ cup (160ml or 5 ½ fl oz) lemon juice;1 cup (250ml or 8 ½ fl oz) water;1 clove garlic crushed;sea salt flakes,"Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F).
Scoop the seeds from the squash and discard. Place squash, cut side up, onto a baking tray. Using the tip of a sharp knife, make some shallow slashes into the squash flesh. Combine the oil, maple, chile, salt and pepper and brush over the squash. Cover with aluminium foil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for a further 40 minutes or until the squash is golden and soft.

22,Chhena Poda (Spiced Cheesecake),ghee for the cake pan;8 ounces paneer preferably homemade;¼ cup confectioners’ sugar;½ teaspoon ground cardamom;2 tablespoons semolina;1½ tablespoons ghee store-bought or homemade;¼ cup whole milk;2 tablespoons roasted cashews;2 tablespoons golden raisins;3 tablespoons granulated sugar;freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds (optional);for serving,"Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee.
In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners’ sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside.
Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so don’t let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but don’t touch it—just let it caramelize on its own.) You will know it’s ready for the cake batter when it’s bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesn’t, use the spatula to create a smooth surface.
Wearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake’s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over—it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan—this is fine).
Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Note: To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar sticking to the surface of the pan before cleaning it.",chhena-poda-paneer-cheesecake,2,0
23,Paneer,2 quarts whole milk;juice of 2 lemons;½ teaspoon kosher salt,"In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195°F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.
Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don’t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don’t panic if this hasn’t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.
Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days.",homemade-paneer-recipe,3,1
24,Sloppy Joe Shirred Eggs With Spinach,1 medium carrot top removed and cut into about 6 pieces;1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes or 2 scant cups roughly chopped fresh tomatoes;2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil divided;3 garlic cloves minced;8 ounces fresh spinach (4 cups packed);3 teaspoons kosher salt divided;1 pound ground turkey;2 teaspoons ground cumin;1 teaspoon smoked paprika;½ teaspoon ground black pepper;½ cup r-rated onions;2 tablespoons red wine vinegar;4 large eggs parmigiano reggiano;for serving (optional),"Preheat your oven to 400°F. Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till it’s as smooth as your blender allows.
In an ovenproof 12-inch sauté pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.
Add the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds.
Add the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like.
Turn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
Slide the skillet onto the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly runny.
To serve, scatter ribbons of Parmigiano Reggiano or another hard cheese over the top. If bread is your thing, this is great with toast.",sloppy-joe-shirred-eggs-with-spinach-vivian-howard,2,1
25,R-Rated Onions,4–5 large or 6–8 medium yellow or white onions;1 tbsp olive or vegetable oil;1 tsp kosher salt,"Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends—longways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.
Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don’t have to stand over it like risotto, but don’t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that’s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don’t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized
About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a ½ cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you’re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you’re done.
Note: R-Rated Onions will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 3 months.",r-rated-caramelized-onions-vivian-howard,4,1

Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside.

Stir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.
Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or ""cheese"" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute.

36,Creole Cream Cheesecake With Caramel-Apple Topping,2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 16 whole crackers);3 tablespoons granulated sugar;3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar;1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt;1⁄2 cup unsalted butter melted;2 pounds cream cheese at room temperature;1 cup granulated sugar;1⅓ cups creole cream cheese;1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste;2 eggs at room temperature;ingredient info: you can substitute 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1⁄4 cup buttermilk for the 1⅓ cups creole cream cheese.;3¾ tablespoons unsalted butter;3⁄4 cup granulated sugar;1⁄4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar;1½ tablespoons honey;4 cups peeled cored and evenly chopped granny smith apples (about 7);1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest;1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice;3⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt;3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon;1⁄3 teaspoon ground cardamom;1⁄3 teaspoon ground ginger;1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won’t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.
Decrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don’t panic—it’ll still be delicious, and you’ll do better next time!
Let the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don’t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you’re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you’ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.
In a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",creole-cream-cheesecake-with-caramel-apple-topping,1,1

38,Buss Up Shut (Paratha Roti),2¼ tsp. nonfat dry milk powder;2 tsp. baking powder;2 tsp. granulated sugar or light brown sugar;2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour plus more for dusting;1 tbsp. vegetable oil plus more;2 tbsp. vegetable shortening room temperature;1 tbsp. ghee;unsalted butter;or vegan butter;room temperature,"Whisk milk powder, baking powder, granulated sugar, and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of ¾ cup warm water (110°) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)
Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.
Roll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6""–diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a ¾"" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don’t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.
Heat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a ⅛""-thick round, about 10–12"".
Brush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that’s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1–2 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go.",buss-up-shut-paratha-roti-ramin-ganeshram,4,0

In a large saucepan, combine mango mixture and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until mangoes are softened.
Have a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles and curry leaves and cook for 15–20 seconds. Add the tempered spice mixture to the saucepan and stir to combine.
Garnish with fried onions (if using). Serve with rice.
Tempering is a traditional method of extracting optimal flavor from Indian spices, and it is a skill learned with practice! Reducing the heat a little before adding the spices prevents the spices from burning and adding a bitterness to your dish.

Once the oven reaches temperature, blend 3 large eggs in a blender until well combined and frothy, 1 minute. Add ¼ cup of the pumpkin purée, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp. allspice, ¼ tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. nutmeg, ½ tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition.

43,Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel,4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3½ lb.) patted dry;4½ tsp. kosher salt divided;2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil divided;2 medium fennel bulbs (about 1 lb.) plus ¼ cup coarsely chopped fronds;1 lb. red flame or green table grapes stems removed (about 2 cups);1 cup unsalted chicken broth;¼ cup honey;4 tsp. calabrian chile paste or chopped calabrian chiles;1 tbsp. red wine vinegar,"Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt.
Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.
Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice ½"" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last ¼"" (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, ½ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside.

46,Pita,1½ cups warm water;1 teaspoon instant yeast;4½ cups (540 grams) bread flour divided plus more as needed;2 tablespoons canola oil plus more for your bowl;3½ teaspoons morton kosher salt,"Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.
Reserve ½ cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.
If you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you’re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
With your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining ½ cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.
Flour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.
Lightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.
Repeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.
Wipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside.
Lightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of “cage” around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.
Space the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy.
Meanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.
When the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.
With firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across.
This next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions—screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you’re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don’t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it— it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it’s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.
Use tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.
Bake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.",fresh-homemade-pita-alon-shaya,1,0
47,Veselka's Famous Borscht,3 pounds (10 to 12) small beets scrubbed thoroughly but not peeled;9 tablespoons white vinegar;one 2-pound boneless pork butt halved;8 cups beef chicken or vegetable stock;1 bay leaf;1 teaspoon whole allspice berries;1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns;3 large carrots peeled and sliced;3 large celery stalks sliced;1 small head of green cabbage (about ¾ to 1 pound) shredded (about 4 cups);2 medium idaho potatoes peeled and cut into ½-inch dice;one 15-ounce can lima beans drained and rinsed;salt,"To make the “beet water,” roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.
To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.
To compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the “beet water” and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",veselkas-famous-borscht,3,0

Let cool and coarsely grind; set aside. Coarsely chop half of papaya into 1"" pieces; set remaining half aside. Coarsely chop half of cilantro (leaves and stems); set remaining cilantro aside.
Transfer chopped papaya to a blender; add oil and blend, adding 1–2 Tbsp. water to get it going if needed, until smooth. Add chopped cilantro, onion, garlic, ginger, ground chile, ¼ tsp. salt, and reserved ground cubeb pepper. Blend mixture to a smooth paste.
Coat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.
Fill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into ½""-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam’s size, but you’re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and ½ tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. (Yams, like many foods that are good for you, can be quite bitter; the sugar will help counter this.) Let soak 30 minutes.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer.

Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6–8 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.)
Toast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won’t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay—you just want to release some of their flavor.
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20–25 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.
Add tomato purée to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30–40 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.
Spoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a ¼"" layer of oil on top.
Do ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
Note: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot—some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don’t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range.

(230 g) romano beans or green beans chopped into 1 in. pieces;2 shallots thinly sliced;1 tsp. red pepper flakes;zest and juice of 1 lemon;1 garlic clove grated;12 pickled green beans (see basic wet salt method below);9 cherry tomatoes quartered;2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil;1 tsp. sherry vinegar;tomato brown butter;crumbled feta;parsley leaves;and marjoram leaves for garnish,"Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.
Drain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.
Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.
Set up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.
In a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Purée until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you’re ready to serve.
While the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the bacon into ¼ in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.
In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.
Increase the heat slightly, and sauté the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.
Thinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.
To serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it’s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.
This works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you’re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don’t have an airlock, you’ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60°F to 68°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks.

Add the butter to a large skillet and gently cook over medium heat until it starts to brown and smell nutty.

Place the squash on a serving platter. If the halves are too large for one serving, cut each piece in half through the stem. Drizzle lightly with extra maple syrup, sprinkle with sea salt, and serve hot.
Acorn squash is hard to cut. To halve a whole squash, plunge the blade of a large chef’s knife into the side of the squash as far as it will go.

Place cucumbers in a colander or sieve set in or over a large bowl; sprinkle with 1 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit while you make the meatballs. (It will seem like a lot of cucumbers at first, but they will shrink down as they drain.)
Meanwhile, drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil over a large rimmed baking sheet. Arrange pine nuts in an even layer on another rimmed baking sheet (use a quarter-sheet if you have one!).
Finely chop ¼ cup olives. Transfer to a large bowl and add egg, garlic, panko, parsley, 1½ tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. red pepper flakes; season with black pepper. Drain raisins and add half to bowl; mix well to combine. Add pork and gently mix with your hands to incorporate.

68,Frozen Avocado Cake,softened butter (for the pan);8 whole graham crackers (120 g);11 digestive biscuits or 4 additional graham crackers (60 g);2 (14 oz/397 g) cans sweetened condensed milk;3 hass avocados;1 pound (455 g) cream cheese at room temperature;pinch fine sea salt;2 lemons;2 limes,"Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.
Make the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add ⅓ cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.
One at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.
Add the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about ⅓ cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Spread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.

Toast them slowly, shaking the pan often, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.
In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.
Pour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.
Set the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.
Add the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you’re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
Localize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts. Fresh out of balsamic vinegar? Red wine vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice will work.",swiss-chard-pasta-with-toasted-hazelnuts-and-parmesan,3,0
71,Sweet Corn Frittata With Cherry Tomato Compote,2 tablespoons olive oil;2 cloves of garlic minced;2 cups cherry tomatoes (any variety will work);¼ cup dry white wine;8 to 10 fresh basil leaves thinly sliced;healthy pinch of fine sea salt;freshly ground black pepper;2 tablespoons cooking fat;1 bunch of scallions white parts and green parts diced separately;2 cloves of garlic minced;1 medium potato scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch chunks;2 cups fresh or thawed frozen corn kernels;4 large eggs;½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes;4 ounces feta cheese;crumbled,"Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes longer. Pour in the wine and cook until the wine is reduced by about half. Add the basil, salt, and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes burst and become fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside the tomatoes in a bowl.
Position an oven rack about 3 inches from the top and preheat the broiler.
In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the diced white part of the scallions and the minced garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the potato and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the potato softens, about 10 minutes. Add the corn and continue to cook for about 2 minutes longer.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, red pepper flakes, and half the feta cheese. Pour the egg mixture over the veggie mixture in the skillet and top with the remainder of the cheese. Stir in the potato mixture and the scallion greens.
Wipe out the skillet and, over medium-high, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking fat. Cook the frittata, lifting up the cooked egg around the edges with a rubber spatula to let the uncooked eggs flow underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, giving the pan a shake now and again, until the eggs are mostly set but the center is still slightly jiggly, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Transfer the frittata to the oven and broil until the top is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes (keep a close eye on the frittata, as it can easily burn). Serve topped with the tomato compote.",sweet-corn-frittata-with-cherry-tomato-compote,4,1

In a large, wide bowl, combine the flour, salt, and parsley. Add the butter pieces and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut them up and into the flour mixture until it resembles little pebbles. Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.
In a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.
In a large skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool.
Meanwhile, thinly slice the tomatoes; toss them with 1 teaspoon salt and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes, tossing them occasionally.
In a bowl, combine the cheeses, mayo, 2 tablespoons each of the chopped basil and parsley, the thyme, a hefty pinch each of salt and pepper, and the sautéed onion.
Sprinkle a little flour in the bottom of a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Set it aside.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the prepared skillet, allowing the edges to extend over the sides of the pan.
Spread the cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the dough. Arrange the tomatoes on top. Gently fold the overhanging pie crust over the tomatoes. It doesn’t have to be perfect.
Drizzle the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking fat and season with pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush the crust with this egg wash, place the cast-iron pan on a rimmed baking sheet (to protect the bottom of your oven from any overflowing filling), and bake the pie until the tomatoes are browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Top the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon each basil and parsley.
Localize it: Swap out any of the herbs or cheeses. The Manchego in this recipe is salty, and the mozzarella melts really well, so just keep that in mind when you’re doing your swaps.",tomato-pie-sour-cream-crust,4,0

Remove escabèche from heat and stir in oregano.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over high. Arrange pork chops in pan so bone ends are in the center (this part cooks slower and this will help with even browning) and press down on pork chops with tongs to ensure surface is making good contact with the pan. Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn pork chops over and press down on them again. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130° for medium (you should still have a little pink flesh; temperature should rise to about 145° when the pork chops rest), 5–7 minutes.

Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, add the potato starch, close the bag, and mix well by flipping the bag over and back again until the chicken is well coated.
Place a large mesh strainer over a bowl.
Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches about 340°F, 8 to 10 minutes. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a tip of a chicken piece into the oil. If it bubbles, it’s ready. Carefully add the chicken to the oil one piece at a time, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.
Deep-fry, turning the chicken with tongs, until all sides are light golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 12 minutes. As each piece is done, transfer it to the strainer. Once the chicken has drained, transfer it to a large bowl. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, making sure to bring the oil back up to 340°F between batches.
Return the oil to 340°F over high heat and carefully add all the chicken—there’s no need to work in batches this time. The chicken will look a little soggy at first. Deep-fry, turning occasionally, until all the chicken pieces are dark golden brown and very crunchy, another 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to the strainer or a rack to drain, then place in a large bowl.
If using the peanuts, place them in a slotted spoon or a small mesh strainer, carefully dip them into the hot oil, and fry for 15 to 30 seconds, just until light golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl.

Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.
When the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.
To serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.
The pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame.

Using a sharp, heavy knife and working just to the side of the center of the breast, cut down through to the breastbone (do not cut all the way through to the backbone). Now that the path has been created, use the same knife—or, easier, a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors—to make a clean cut all the way through the breastbone and anything else that is still connecting the 2 sides of the breast together. Open up chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on chicken to flatten. Pat thoroughly dry.
Grind peppercorns in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor or leave in mortar and pestle and add garlic, cilantro roots, brown sugar, fish sauce, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, and cardamom and process or pound until smooth.

Grind saffron to a fine powder in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and add granulated sugar, salt, and ¼ cup water and cook over medium heat just until heated through and small bubbles appear around the edges of the pan. Whisk in coconut oil and remove from heat.
If using a grill, prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on cooler part of grill. Close lid and grill, rotating chicken but keeping skin side up every 5–10 minutes, until skin looks dry and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130°–140°, 35–40 minutes. If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.
Uncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160° and thickest part of thighs registers 165°, 10–15 minutes longer.

Whisk egg yolks and 1 Tbsp. cold water in a small bowl to combine.
Whisk all-purpose flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and rub and smash into dry ingredients with your fingers to create large, shaggy pieces (you want some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and irregular).
Drizzle egg yolk mixture over flour and, using a fork or your fingers, toss into dough to incorporate. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry; although, if it looks too dry and doesn't come together, add 1–2 Tbsp. more water, but only if needed).
Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times. Divide dough in half, stack pieces, and press down firmly to smash together. Repeat process until dough is well combined and becomes slightly sticky, 2—3 more times. Press dough into bottom and 1"" up sides of pan and prick all over with a fork. Freeze until very firm, 20–30 minutes.
Bake crust until deep golden brown all over, 35–40 minutes. Let cool.
Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
Bring milk and vanilla paste to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl, starting slowly—it won’t want to combine easily at first—then vigorously whisk until mixture is very pale yellow and very thick, about 1 minute (the sugar should be nearly dissolved at this point). Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture. Return custard base to saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Simmer, still whisking constantly, until custard is thickened and has no cornstarch taste, about 3 minutes.
Remove custard from heat and add butter a couple of pieces at a time, whisking until fully melted before adding more, until all of the butter is incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface. Let cool.

80,Peach and Sesame Crumble,⅓ cup raw sesame seeds;1 lemon;2½ lb. peaches (6–7) thinly sliced;⅓ cup plus 1¼ cups sugar;1¾ tsp. kosher salt divided;1 cup all-purpose flour;½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter;½ tsp. ground cinnamon;⅓ cup tahini;2 tsp. toasted sesame oil;1—2 tsp. cornstarch;vanilla ice cream (for serving; optional),"Place a rack in top third of oven; preheat to 375°F. Toast sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Immediately transfer to a large bowl.
Meanwhile, finely grate zest from lemon into a medium bowl; set aside. Place peaches in a 13x9"" baking dish. Halve lemon and squeeze 1 Tbsp. juice over peaches, then sprinkle ⅓ cup sugar and ¾ tsp. salt over. Toss to gently combine, then let sit while you prep the topping, at least 20 minutes.
Add flour and remaining 1¼ cups sugar and 1 tsp. salt to bowl with sesame seeds. Whisk to combine.
Add butter and cinnamon to bowl with lemon zest. Microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. (Or, if you don't have a microwave, melt butter with cinnamon and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium.) Whisk in tahini and oil.
Scrape tahini mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated (mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand).
The peaches should look juicy at this point. Add 1 tsp. cornstarch. If they’re really juicy, add another 1 tsp. Gently toss to combine. (If your peaches happen to be not-so-ripe and aren't juicy, don't add any cornstarch.)
Squeeze topping into big clumps, then break off uneven pieces and scatter over peaches.

82,Melted Broccoli Pasta With Capers and Anchovies,kosher salt;2 heads (about 1 pound or 454g total) broccoli cut into bitesize florets;12 ounces (340 g) whole-wheat penne pasta or other short tubular pasta;3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil divided;1 cup (54 g) panko or freezer bread crumbs (see note);4 oil-packed anchovy fillets;¼ cup (36 g) capers chopped if large (rinsed well if salt-packed);2 garlic cloves minced;¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli florets and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to a large bowl.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast the bread crumbs. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil in a large, high-sided sauté pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and sauté until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the pan. Add the anchovies and sauté until they disintegrate, about 1 minute. Add the capers, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute, and remove from the heat.
When the pasta is ready, reserve 1½ cups (360 ml) of pasta water with a measuring cup, then drain the pasta. Add the broccoli and reserved pasta water to the pan and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, using a wooden spoon to break the florets into small pieces as they become more tender, until the water is reduced by about half and you've been able to break apart enough florets that you're left with a very chunky mixture, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add the pasta to the pan. Cook, tossing and stirring, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add half the toasted bread crumbs, and toss again to combine. Serve garnished with the remaining toasted bread crumbs.",melted-broccoli-pasta-sheela-prakash,4,1
83,Dashi,1 gallon cold water;1 (6-inch) square dashima (kombu);3 medium dried shiitake mushrooms;12 large dried anchovies (gutted and heads removed),"Put the water, dashima, shiitake mushrooms, and anchovies in a covered stockpot or other large pot and let stand at room temperature overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.
Remove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.
Strain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.
It’s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.
Vegetarians can make a dashi from just dashima and dried shiitakes.",my-korea-dashi-hooni-kim,1,1
84,Ginger and Tamarind Refresher,2½ cups (600 ml) water;2½ oz (70 g) sour tamarind pulp or paste;8 oz (225 g) fresh ginger preferably young;1 cup (200 g) sugar;one 1 l bottle chilled club soda or 4 cups (960 ml) chilled water,"Bring 1½ cups (360 ml) of the water to a boil. Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.
Rinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.
In a large pitcher, mix the tamarind extract and the ginger simple syrup together. Fill eight tall glasses with ice. Pour 4 oz (120 ml) of the tamarind-ginger syrup into each glass, top with 4 oz (120 ml) of the club soda or chilled water, and stir. Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
This rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It’s wonderful during the warmer months. Young ginger requires no peeling before use because its outer skin is so thin. I recommend using South Asian tamarind, which is a lot more sour than the Mexican variety. Look for it in Asian and Indian markets.",ginger-and-tamarind-refresher-nik-sharma,2,1
85,Sumac and Saffron Refresher,15 to 20 saffron strands plus a few extra strands for garnish;½ cup (100 g) sugar;3 green cardamom pods smashed;¼ cup (30 g) ground sumac;3 cups (700 ml) chilled club soda or water,"Grind the saffron with 2 Tbsp. of sugar to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup (240 ml) water, sugar, cardamom, and powdered saffron mixture and bring to simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.
To serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Sumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",sumac-and-saffron-refresher-nik-sharma,1,0

Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.) Turn the heat to medium and add the chiles. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chiles are thoroughly cooked.
At this point, warm a separate frying pan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.
Once the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.
Sprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat.

Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 1½"" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you’ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

100,Stuffed Eggplants and Zucchini in a Rich Tomato Sauce (Baatingan w Kusaa Bil Banadoura),2½ tbsp olive oil;2 onions finely diced (2½ cups/350g);4 cups/1kg tomato puree;12¼ oz/350g ripe tomatoes (2 large) coarsely grated;3¼ cups/750ml chicken stock or water;1 tbsp sugar;salt and black pepper;¾ cup plus 2 tbsp/175g egyptian rice or arborio rice (see note below);9 oz/250g ground lamb;¼ cup/60ml olive oil;½ tsp ground cinnamon;¾ tsp ground allspice;½ tsp ground cumin;about 3 green onions finely sliced (⅓ cup/35g);¾ cup/15g mint leaves roughly chopped;¾ cup/15g parsley leaves roughly chopped;1 cup/20g dill roughly chopped;1 red chile seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g);1 lemon: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp;3 tbsp water;1½ lb/700g eggplants (between 3 and 6 depending on size);1½ lb/700g zucchini (between 3 and 6 depending on size);7 tbsp/100ml olive oil;6 garlic cloves finely chopped;1 tbsp coriander seeds lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle;1 red chile seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g);¼ cup/5g parsley leaves roughly chopped;¼ cup/5g mint leaves roughly torn;¼ cup/5g dill leaves;1 green onion thinly sliced (2 tbsp/10g);1 cup/250g greek yogurt,"To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lid—about 10 inches/25cm wide—and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.
To make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.
Trim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin—about ⅛ inch/3mm away—but not so close that it tears and won’t hold its shape when it’s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don’t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife—be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!
Use the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about ⅛ inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about ½ inch/1cm from the end intact—they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.
Using your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about ½ inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.
Gently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won’t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft—test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don’t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.
To make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don’t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside—it will crisp up as it cools down—and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.
When the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha—the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic—then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside.",stuffed-eggplants-and-zucchini-tomato-sauce-falastin,4,1

Stir, then drain through a colander, squeezing out most of the moisture from the bread. (If using grated zucchini, toss it with ½ tsp of salt and place in a sieve set over a bowl. Let to sit for 20 minutes, then use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.)
Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl with the chicken, garlic, spices, herbs, lemon zest, ¾ tsp salt, and plenty of black pepper. Using well-oiled hands, shape into about 30 small balls; roughly a scant 1 oz/25g each.
Put 1 tbsp of oil into a large nonstick sauté pan with a lid, and place over high heat. Once hot, add half the meatballs and cook for 2–3 minutes, turning throughout, until golden brown all over. Transfer the meatballs to a baking sheet and set aside. Keep the pan on the heat and continue with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and remaining meatballs in the same way.
Return the same pan to medium-high heat. Add the 2 garlic cloves, lemon rind, and stock and bring to a boil—this should take about 3 minutes. Add the molokhieh (or the spinach and okra combination), cinnamon, 2 tsp of salt, and plenty of black pepper, then decrease the heat to medium and cook, covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the molokhieh is bubbling and completely defrosted. Add the meatballs, parsley, and ½ cup/10g of cilantro and cook, covered, for another 10 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Stir in the lemon juice.
To make the adha, meanwhile, put the olive oil into a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crispy. Add the chile flakes, then remove from the heat and pour into a bowl. Stir in the cilantro and set aside.

Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about ⅔ cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.
Lightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.
Stir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.

(Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.
Remove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple.

116,Bibingkang Cassava (Cassava Cake),4 egg yolks beaten;one 1-lb (500 g) package frozen grated cassava thawed;1 cup (250 g) jarred macapuno coconut strings or sweetened shredded coconut;1½ cups (375 ml) canned unsweetened coconut milk;½ cup (125 ml) sweetened condensed milk;4 egg whites;¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk,"Preheat the oven to 350°F.
To make the cake, combine the egg yolks, cassava, macapuno (or shredded coconut, if using), coconut milk and the ½ cup sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl and mix well.
Pour the cake batter into a greased 8 x 8-in (20 x 20-cm) cake pan. The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but don’t worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45–60 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the ¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, don’t be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined.
Remove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more.
Remove the cake from the oven and rest the cake in its pan on a cooling rack. Cool the cake completely before cutting it into squares. The cassava cake can be served at room temperature, or cold out of the refrigerator.",cassava-cake-bibingkang-cassava,1,0
117,Peach Cobbler,10 large peaches (about 4½ pounds) unpeeled cut into 1-inch chunks;zest and juice of 1 large lemon;½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter softened;2 cups sugar divided;1½ cups (about 192 grams) all-purpose flour;2 teaspoons baking powder;1 teaspoon kosher salt;¾ cup whole milk;½ cup hot tap water;heavy cream;for serving,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.
In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it’s no more than about ½ inch thick in any one place.
Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It’s a strange method, but it works.)
Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry—be sure to check in a few places.)
Let the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top.",peach-cobbler-hot-water,4,0
118,Pajeon (파 전 / Scallion Pancakes),2 cups all-purpose flour;½ cup cornstarch;2 teaspoons baking powder;2 teaspoons sugar;1 teaspoon doenjang (korean fermentedsoybean paste);½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper;2 cups ice-cold club soda;1 medium egg yolk;2 teaspoons minced garlic;3 bunches scallions cut into 2-inch batons (if the scallions are thick cut the white parts lengthwise in half before cutting into batons);about 5 tablespoons grape seed or canola oil for frying;pajeon sauce,"To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.
When you’re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.
Set a 10-inch nonstick sauté pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don’t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200°F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it’s best to eat them right away.
Cut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).",scallion-pancakes-pajeon,2,1

120,Shaak-no Sambharo (Quick Pickled Vegetables),⅓ cup vegetable oil;4 tbsp. whole black mustard seeds (or 4 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed mustard seeds);3 tbsp. whole fenugreek seeds (or 3 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed fenugreek);1 tsp. asafetida powder;1 tbsp. ground cayenne (to taste) or 1 large serrano pepper deseeded and sliced thin;⅓ cup julienned ginger (optional see pre-prep below);2-4 tbsp. white vinegar;2 tsp. kosher salt (optional);2 cups mixed vegetables;prepped as follows,"Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.
If using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.
Method: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.
To Store: Use smaller (4 – 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don’t worry if you don’t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination.",shaak-no-sambharo-quick-pickled-vegetables,3,1

Then add the salt with the hot (but not scalding) water and knead well. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s a little dry, add more hot water. The kneaded dough should be slightly tacky but not sticking to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each one into a round ball. Roll each ball between sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap into as thin a round as possible (the rounds will contract a bit when you stop rolling). As you roll each one, place it on a hot nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
Cook for about 30 seconds, or until the tortilla starts to puff. Then flip and cook another 30 seconds. It should be cooked through and just speckled with golden brown spots.

138,Grilled Peach Toast With Pimiento Cheese,2 firm-ripe peaches halved and pitted;2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon blended oil;1 medium-size ripe avocado;4 (1⁄2-inch-thick) slices multigrain boule-style bread;smoky pimiento cheese with bacon;2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil;1⁄4 cup thinly sliced red radishes (about 3 ounces);1 bunch watercress;1 teaspoon gray sea salt;1⁄2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper,"Preheat a grill to medium-high (450°F).
Brush the peach halves with 1 tablespoon of the blended oil, and place on the grill grates, cut sides down. Grill, uncovered, until grill marks appear and the juices begin to release, about 3 minutes. Remove from the grill, and slice. Set aside.
Cut the avocado in half lengthwise, pit, and brush cut sides with 1 teaspoon of the blended oil. Place halves, cut sides down, on the grill grates. Grill, uncovered, just until the avocado is charred and begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill.
Brush the bread slices with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and place on the grill grates. Grill until the bread is toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the grill.

139,Homestyle Dosas with Tomato Chutney,2 cups long-grain white rice;½ cup whole or split urad dal (black gram);½ tsp. fenugreek seeds;1 tsp. kosher salt;2 tsp. plus 2 tbsp. vegetable oil;1 small onion finely chopped;2–3 small green chiles (such as serrano) seeds removed if desired finely chopped;4 small tomatoes or canned whole peeled tomatoes chopped;kosher salt;2 tsp. black mustard seeds;8–10 fresh or frozen curry leaves;1 dried red chile (such as bird or chile de árbol);1 tsp. split or whole urad dal (black gram);a pinch of asafoetida (optional);1 tsp. ghee or clarified butter;melted;divided;plus more for griddle,"The morning before you make your batter, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water, until water runs almost clear. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.
Pick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.
Drain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then purée, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.
Add reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4–6 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.
Do ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.
Heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7–9 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.
Wipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.
To cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you’re good to go. (It’s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it’s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it’s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous ⅓-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8""-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle ⅛ tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.
Serve dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.",homestyle-dosas-with-tomato-chutney,1,0
140,Shimbra Wat (Chickpeas With Spicy Flaxseed Paste),3 tablespoons brown or golden flaxseed;3 tablespoons awaze dipping sauce;14 oz (400 g) cooked or canned chickpeas drained and rinsed;salt,"Heat a small dry frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the flaxseed and lightly dry-toast for about 2 minutes, stirring and shaking the pan, until aromatic. Transfer to a dish and leave to cool. Once cool, grind using an electric spice or coffee grinder.
In a Dutch oven or sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of water over low heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the awaze. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously, then gradually work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of awaze, along with the ground flaxseed and 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add a touch more water if it looks like the mixture is drying out—it should still be a bit runny at the end.
Meanwhile, place the chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and soak in the liquid until ready to use. Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of the liquid. Add the chickpeas to the awaze-flaxseed mixture, generously season with salt, and mix well. Tip in some of the reserved cooking water if needed so that the sauce is a touch runny and evenly coats the chickpeas.

152,Grilled Cauliflower Wedges With Herb Tarator,¼ cup sliced or slivered almonds;2 garlic cloves finely grated;1 cup chopped dill;½ cup mint leaves;½ cup tahini;⅓ cup fresh lemon juice;kosher salt freshly ground pepper;1 small cauliflower (about 1½ lb.);¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling);½ tsp. ground coriander;½ tsp. ground cumin;½ tsp. turmeric;handful of tender herbs (such as dill;mint;parsley;cilantro;basil;and/or chives),"Toast almonds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Set aside for serving.
Blend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and ⅓ cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1–2 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny. Season with salt and lots of pepper.
Remove outer leaves and trim stem from cauliflower so it sits flat. Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.
Whisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it’s done), 10–15 minutes. (And if you don’t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)

153,Open-Face Mushroom Sandwiches With Pecorino Salsa Verde,"3 medium shallots thinly sliced crosswise rings separated;1 tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. red wine vinegar;1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes;1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper;kosher salt;3 oz. pecorino romano grana padano or parmigiano-reggiano;2 cups (loosely packed) mixed tender herb leaves or greens (such as parsley and dill or dill and arugula);5 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil;1 lb. king trumpet or crimini mushrooms trimmed;6 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil;6 1""-thick slices country-style bread","Six–eight 10"" metal skewers or bamboo skewers, soaked (optional)
Toss shallots, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a small bowl to combine; lightly season with salt (the Pecorino will add some saltiness, so bear that in mind). Let sit 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, very thinly slice Pecorino into tiles with a knife (irregular pieces are okay).
Add Pecorino, herbs, and oil to pickled shallots and toss gently to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed; set aside.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; clean grate. Working one at a time, set mushrooms on their sides and slice lengthwise ¼"" thick to make 3–4 planks per mushroom, depending their size. If your mushrooms are particularly small or you are using crimini, slice ½"" thick and thread onto skewers to keep them from falling through grate.
Using some of the oil, brush cut sides of mushrooms and transfer to a large bowl or arrange on a rimmed baking sheet if skewered. Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with remaining oil and transfer to a platter.
Press each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.
Brush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6–8 minutes for small pieces and 8–10 minutes for large ones.

154,Hickory-Smoked Baby Back Ribs,5 tbsp (75 ml) packed brown sugar;3 tbsp (45 ml) kosher salt;2 tbsp (30 ml) sweet smoked paprika 4 tsp (20 ml) ancho chili powder;1 tbsp (15 ml) paprika;1 tbsp (15 ml) onion powder;1 tbsp (15 ml) freshly cracked black pepper 2 tsp (10 ml) dried thyme leaves;6 racks baby back ribs about 6 lb (2.7 kg);4 medium chunks hickory wood soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a charcoal grill) or 4 cups (1 l) hickory wood chips soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a gas grill);3⁄4 cup (185 ml) apple cider;1⁄2 cup (125 ml) ketchup;3 tbsp (45 ml) red wine vinegar;1 tbsp (15 ml) dijon mustard;2 tsp (10 ml) light soy sauce;1 tsp (5 ml) worcestershire sauce;1 tsp (5 ml) molasses;1⁄2 tsp (2 ml) ancho chili powder;1⁄2 tsp (2 ml) ground cumin;1⁄2 tsp (2 ml) minced garlic;1⁄4 tsp (1 ml) freshly ground black pepper,"For the ribs, stir together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, regular paprika, onion powder, black pepper and thyme. Set aside.
With a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)
Spread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.
Fire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300°F (120 to 150°C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.
Drain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.
Place the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300°F (120 and 150°C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.
Once the ribs are on, it’s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don’t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.
The first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes.",hickory-smoked-baby-back-ribs-rob-rainford,4,1

Stir to combine, then cover and simmer until the aromatics are completely softened and the liquid thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Stir in the orange juice and season with more salt to taste. Transfer the hot sauce to a resealable glass jar and refrigerate until ready to use. (The hot sauce will keep for up to 2 weeks.)
Make the lime sour cream: In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, lime zest and juice, and salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Make the plantains: Fill a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot about two-thirds of the way with vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 375°F.
With a very sharp knife, peel the plantains, then slice lengthwise about ⅛ inch thick. Working in batches, fry the plantains in the hot oil, flipping occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to drain.

Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
To make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it’s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.
To make the purée, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.
To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn’t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150°F (65°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.
Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don’t panic—this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.
Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don’t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it’s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry purée on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.
Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I’ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",roasted-strawberry-layer-cake-new-way-to-cake,2,1

Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry.

Soak the rice in water, generously covered, for at least 30 minutes. (This is optional but results in softer, more evenly cooked rice.) Drain thoroughly using a fine-mesh sieve.
In a soup pot, dry-roast and stir the lentils continuously over medium heat until they are golden brown and have a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. (This step is optional but reduces the stickiness of the dal.) Thoroughly wash the lentils using a fine mesh colander. Return them to the pot, together with the rice, and add 3 1⁄2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim the foam off the top. Add the turmeric powder, 2 tablespoons of the ghee, and the ginger to the boiling mixture.
While the rice and lentils are cooking, put 1⁄2 teaspoon of the ghee in a tempering pot or small pan over medium heat.

Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee in the tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. When melted, add the crushed black peppercorns and cumin seeds and the asafetida. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Turn off the heat.
Immediately pour the spiced ghee over the rice. To get all of the spiced ghee out of the pot, put a spoonful of the rice mixture into the pot, stir, and spoon it back into the rest of the dish. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Garnish with the reserved cashews. Serve hot.",khara-huggi-or-pongal-chitra-agrawal-vibrant-india,4,1
194,Jalapeño Pepper Jelly,½ cup coarsely chopped seeded jalapeños (about 3 medium);½ cup coarsely chopped green bell pepper;3 cups organic cane sugar;½ cup apple cider vinegar;1 (3-ounce) package liquid pectin,"Sterilize three ½-pint jars and their lids or similarly sized lidded storage containers.
In a food processor, combine the jalapeños and the bell pepper and process, scraping down the sides as needed, until the peppers are very finely chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. (They will let off quite a bit of liquid; this is okay.)
Transfer the contents of the food processor to a 4-quart stainless-steel or enameled Dutch oven. Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Boil, still stirring, for 3 minutes, then squeeze in the pectin. Return the mixture to a rolling boil, stirring continuously, and cook for 1 minute. Immediately remove from the heat and let rest until the foam has settled, about 1 minute. Skim off and discard any remaining foam.
Spoon the jelly into the sterilized jars and let cool for 1 hour. Seal the jars and refrigerate until chilled before using. The jelly will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 months and up to 2 years if processed in a hot water bath and kept in a cool, dry place.",jalapeno-pepper-jelly-bryant-terry,1,1
195,Win Son Bakery's Red Date Cake,6 tbsp. unsalted butter room temperature plus more for pan;6 oz. pitted dried red dates coarsely chopped (about 2 cups);½ tsp. baking soda;1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour;2 tsp. baking powder;1 tsp. kosher salt;¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar;½ tsp. vanilla extract;2 large eggs;4 whole pitted dried red dates;¼ cup heavy cream;4 tbsp. unsalted butter;¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar;½ tsp. kosher salt,"A 9""-diameter springform pan
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter pan; set aside. Bring dates, baking soda, and ¾ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Let cool.
Sift flour into a medium bowl; mix in baking powder and salt. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat granulated sugar, vanilla, and remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition; beat until mixture is very light and airy, about 3 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and beat just until incorporated. Mix in cooled date mixture, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat until just combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface to make an even layer.
Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25–30 minutes.
While the cake bakes, make the glaze. Slice each date in half lengthwise, then thinly slice each half into strips. Place in a small bowl and pour in ½ cup boiling water to cover; let soak.
Cook cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar as needed, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Bring just to a simmer and cook, stirring, until glaze thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool until glaze thickens further but is still pourable, about 15 minutes.
Remove cake from springform pan and slide onto a platter or large plate. Arrange drained date strips along edge of cake so they look like spokes on a wheel. Carefully drizzle warm glaze over cake, so it drips over the edges. Let cool completely before serving.",win-son-bakerys-red-date-cake-jujubes,2,0
196,Kong Jaban (Korean Sweet Black Beans),1¼ cups dried black beans rinsed and picked over;2 quarts dashi or water plus more if needed;1 cup soy sauce;¾ cup sugar;2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil;1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds,"Soak the beans in enough water to cover them by 3 inches in a covered container in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours.
Drain the beans, put them in a pot, and add the dashi or water and soy sauce. Set over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring the beans on a regular basis. The level of liquid will reduce as the beans cook; once it gets to the point where it does not completely cover the beans, you will need to stir more often to ensure that the beans cook evenly. After an hour, the beans should be tender but still retain a little bite. If they are still hard, add more dashi or water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until the beans are tender with a little bite.
Add the sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds to the pot and mix well. (It’s important to wait to add the sugar until the beans are tender, as adding it in the beginning will cause the beans to harden when refrigerated.) Let the beans cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (The beans will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.)
Serve the beans cold with hot rice.",korean-stewed-sweet-black-beans-kong-jaban,1,1
197,Agua de Limón con Chía (Limeade With Chia Seeds),3 large limes quartered;4 cups water;1/2 cup sugar or more if needed;1/4 cup chia seeds,"Put the limes, water, and sugar in a blender and pulse 3 to 4 times, just enough to extract the juice from the limes but not crush the skins (which would make the drink too bitter). Strain through a fi ne-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Taste and add more sugar if you like.
Whisk in the chia seeds and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, until completely chilled. Stir before serving, then serve over ice.",agua-de-limon-con-chia-limeade-with-chia-seeds,2,0

Cut them into chunks and pass them through a juicer.
Combine the water and sugar in a pitcher and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the beet juice.
Refrigerate until completely chilled. Add the apple, banana, orange, and lettuce, then stir in the lime juice (which will help prevent the fruit from browning). Serve chilled over ice, if desired.
Alternately, divide the mixed diced fruit among the glasses; place the beet water in a pitcher for guests to pour over.",lagrimas-de-la-virgen-beet-cooler-fany-gerson,1,0

Standard blender jars probably won’t fit all the ingredients so blend in batches. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Add sugar (or your preferred sweetener) to taste, adjusting for your own preference and based on how sweet the fruit is to begin with. Add enough ice to your liking. As an option, you can garnish with a piece of an ingredient in the agua. For example, a sprig of rosemary, a stick of cinnamon, or slices of lemon.
